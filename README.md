# Text Editor Starter Code
This project uses a combination of IndexedDB and Local Storage to create a simply text editor that will persist what you put in it--even after you've closed the browser! This application is also a Progessive Web App (PWA), leveraging a service worker built by Workbox to make it available offline, adn installable locally.
